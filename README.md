 <h1>DESCRIPTION 📖</h1>

# 👩🏾‍💻🏳️‍🌈Marcia Mijnhijmer🏳️‍🌈👩🏾‍💻 Makes a Weather Dashboard - Is it Always Sunny?

## Task: <br/>
Create a web-based weather dashboard that displays a 5-day forecast for a city, <br>
using the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and localStorage to store persistent data.

# User Story
AS A traveler<br>
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities<br>
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly<br>

<br>

# Acceptance Criteria
The app should:

- Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
   - When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
   - When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
      - The city name
      - The date
      - An icon representation of weather conditions
      - The temperature
      - The humidity
      - The wind speed
  - When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
      - The date
      - An icon representation of weather conditions
      - The temperature
      - The humidity
  - When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city



# Improvement I want to make:
- use navigator geolocation to get the users location to display the weather data.
- Implement a carsousel to displaya wider range of forecast
