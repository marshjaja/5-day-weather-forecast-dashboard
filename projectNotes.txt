QUESTION FROM CLASS:
Regarding to the history search limitation while understanding its not requirement, is there any function that adds one into an array and remove one(either the first item or the last one out), setting for instance 5 items in the array? 
[item1, item2, item3, item4, item5 ] 
-> adding item 6
[item2, item3, item4, item5, item6 ]


ANSWER FROM CLASS:
One of the way to do this is to first delete the last item in the array and then add now item to the beginning of the array
it can look like this first arra.pop, and then array.shift for example
sorry array.unshift() to add at the beginning of the array 👍
